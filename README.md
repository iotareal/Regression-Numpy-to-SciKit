# Regression: Numpy-to-SciKit
This Repository is about my journey From Numpy to Scikit, I basically created myself a improvised implementation of regression alogorithms in NumPy and then finally desigend the same regression model using SciKit learn library, Numpy is a python library used to demonstrate or perform complex mathematical operations efficiently on the computer, SciKit learn is a Machine Learning Python Library primarily have pre-defined functions of Regression, Classification and Clustering machine learning algorithms.
